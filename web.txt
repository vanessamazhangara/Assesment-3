How does the internet work? What happens when you click on a link?

The internet-or the world wide web- operates on a implicit agreed upon language(protocol) that allows webpages and sthe like to interact with local clients & servers. HTTP(S) stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, this is the protocol that web uses when making a network or requests. When you clink on a url link, one of two things happens: the local client sends a request to site's server, once that request is receiver the server will then configure that data and transmit back to the client. That data will be displayed on the given webpage.
